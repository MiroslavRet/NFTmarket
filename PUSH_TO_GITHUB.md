## 📝 What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files committed (commit hash: d8159a7)
- ✅ Branch set to 'main'
- ✅ Remote added: origin → https://github.com/MiroslavRet/boltDapp.git
- ✅ Supabase updated with GitHub URL
- ⏳ **Ready to push** (requires your credentials)

## 🔧 Alternative: Using SSH

If you prefer SSH (and have SSH keys set up):

```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:MiroslavRet/boltDapp.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If push is rejected:
The repository might not be empty. Check if you initialized it with a README. If so:

```bash
# Pull first
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### If authentication fails:
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
- Token must have 'repo' scope
- Double-check username is exactly: `MiroslavRet`

## ✅ Success Verification

After pushing successfully, verify:

1. Visit: https://github.com/MiroslavRet/boltDapp
2. Check all files are there
3. README displays on homepage
4. Documentation files are accessible
5. Clone and test:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MiroslavRet/boltDapp.git test
   cd test/offchain
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once pushed, your template will be:
- ✅ Permanently stored on GitHub
- ✅ Version controlled
- ✅ Clonable from anywhere
- ✅ Usable in Bolt.new
